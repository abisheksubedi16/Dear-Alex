Dear <b>Alex Sharma</b>,

Happy 13th birthday! May this special day bring you an abundance of joy and happiness. As
someone who loves physical games and has a passion for football, I hope you score the winning
goal in all of your matches. Additionally, as someone who enjoys playing Free Fire on your mobile 
phone, I hope you continue to have fun battling it out with your friends and mastering the game. 
I also know that your favorite character in Free Fire is Wukong, so here's wishing that you
continue to have success and victory with him by your side.

Lastly, I couldn't forget to mention that you affectionately call "<b>dinosaur</b>". May your bond
with them continue to grow and flourish as you both navigate through the teenage years together.

Once again, happy birthday,<b>Alex</b>! May all your dreams and aspirations come true, and
may you have an unforgettable year ahead filled with love, laughter, and cherished memories.

Warm regards,
Dinosaur Mess
